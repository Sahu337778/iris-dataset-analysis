# Iris Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Model

Explore the Iris dataset using machine learning techniques. This repository includes data analysis, visualization, and classification models to identify Iris plant species. Models such as Logistic Regression and an optimized Decision Tree are employed for accurate classification.  machine learning algorithms.


## Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of the Iris dataset, exploring its attributes and species classification using various machine learning models.

### Overview
- Imported the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Created a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated the structure, integrity, and types of data.
- Used descriptive statistics, visualizations (scatter plots, pair plots, boxplots, KDE plots) to analyze distributions and relationships among features.
- Identified class separability and possible outliers.

## Model Building and Evaluation
- Utilized various classification models: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.
- Employed train-test splitting and cross-validation.
- Analyzed model performance, bias, variance, and accuracy.

## Scaling and Model Optimization
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
- Retrained models to check for improvements but encountered issues like high variance or overfitting.
- Used `GridSearchCV` to optimize the Decision Tree Classifier, achieving a model with reduced bias and variance.

## Conclusion
- Models, particularly Logistic Regression and the optimized Decision Tree, exhibit good performance for classifying Iris plant species.
- The dataset provides a valuable resource for practicing various machine learning techniques and model optimization methods.
