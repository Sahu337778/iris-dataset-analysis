**Iris Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Model**

Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of the Iris dataset, exploring its attributes and species classification using various machine learning models.

Libraries Used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning model building.
Dataset Overview
Loading and Understanding Data
Imported the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Created a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Investigated the structure, integrity, and types of data.
Used descriptive statistics, visualizations (scatter plots, pair plots, boxplots, KDE plots) to analyze distributions and relationships among features.
Identified class separability and possible outliers.
Insights
Identified that Petal Length & Petal Width are crucial attributes for identifying flower types.
Noted that the Setosa species is easily distinguishable, while Virginica & Versicolor show some overlap.
Model Building and Evaluation
Data Preparation
Split the dataset into features and the target variable.
Employed train-test splitting.
Model Training
Utilized various classification models: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.
Evaluated models for bias, variance, and accuracy.
Initial Results
Logistic Regression appeared as the best-fit model due to low bias and variance.
Scaling and Model Optimization
Scaled features using StandardScaler.
Retrained models to check for improvements but encountered issues like high variance or overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Used GridSearchCV to optimize the Decision Tree Classifier.
Achieved a model with reduced bias and variance.
Decision Tree Visualization
Generated a visual representation of the optimized Decision Tree.
Cross-Validation and Accuracy Calculation
Employed cross-validation to estimate model performance across multiple folds.
Achieved an average accuracy of approximately 97%.
Conclusion
Models, particularly Logistic Regression and the optimized Decision Tree, exhibit good performance for classifying Iris plant species.
